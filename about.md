## 🧬 Who I Am

I am a **Cybersecurity Engineer** with a unique background that blends:

- Cloud & infrastructure engineering  
- DevSecOps & security automation  
- Network defense and secure design  
- Research, mentoring, and leadership  

I enjoy working at the intersection of **security, reliability, and engineering discipline**—especially where I can turn good security ideas into **repeatable, automated workflows**.

---

## 🎓 Academic & Research Background

I hold a **PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering**, where my work focused on:

- Regenerative engineering and tissue mechanics  
- Complex experimental design and analysis  
- Translating research into practical, testable systems  

That research mindset directly influences how I approach cybersecurity:

- Form hypotheses → build experiments (labs / PoCs)  
- Measure results → iterate and improve  
- Document the process so others can learn from it

## 🔐 Why Cybersecurity & DevSecOps

I’m drawn to cybersecurity because it:

- **Protects real people and missions**  
- Demands both **technical depth** and **clear communication**  
- Rewards those who are willing to keep learning and stay curious  

DevSecOps, in particular, lets me:

- Push security **earlier into the pipeline**  
- Use automation to reduce repetitive, error-prone work  
- Give teams fast, useful feedback about risk and misconfigurations  

This portfolio is part of that journey: small, focused labs that demonstrate **how I think as an engineer and defender**.

## 🧭 How I Work

I try to bring the following mindset to every project:

- **Secure by default** — start from safe baselines, then open only what’s needed  
- **Automate the boring & brittle** — scripts and pipelines over manual steps  
- **Explain the why** — not just *what* a control is, but *why* it matters  
- **Iterate in small steps** — ship something working, then improve it  

Whether I’m working on Terraform for AWS, Ansible hardening, or a Python automation script, the goal is the same: **make security easier to do correctly**.

## 🚀 What I’m Building Toward

- Deeper integration of container and dependency scanning into CI/CD  
- Stronger cloud security postures with more advanced AWS patterns  
- Teaching and mentoring others through well-documented labs and examples
